1. Inline CSS
CSS is added directly inside the HTML element using the style attribute.

Used for quick styling of a single element.

2. Internal CSS
CSS is written inside a <style> tag within the <head> section of the HTML document.

Good for single-page websites.



3. External CSS
CSS is placed in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML using the <link> tag.

Best for large websites (reusable and clean).
